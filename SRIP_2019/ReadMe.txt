The current version of programme analyses the articulatory features of voiced and unvoiced sound samples. 
The programme uses two default sound samples, either of them can be chosen from the dropdown menu. The samples are two distinct phonemes with voiced and unvoiced attributes. The sound segments are extracted from two different words having voiced and unvoiced properties;
e.g. phoneme /b/ from word "book" - voiced/plosive and phoneme /p/ from word "please" - 
unvoiced/fricative

The current version of programme displays the distinct features of voiced and unvoiced sound samples.

In order to run the programme follow these steps:
i) run the html file on browser.
ii) From dropdown button [select sound] select voiced or unvoiced sound sample.
iii) To generate the waveform for any of the selected sound samples click on the generate button. 

The current version of programme only generates the waveform for voiced and unvoiced sound samples which helps to get the initial gist of the  attributes the selected sound sample pertains. 

Form the plot the following fundamental features can be observed:
i) Voiced sound sample plot possess a uniform impulses which are periodic in nature. 
ii) Unvoiced sound sample plot is made up of random noise. 
iii) And the amplitude of voiced sound is higher than the amplitude of the unvoiced sound samples.
